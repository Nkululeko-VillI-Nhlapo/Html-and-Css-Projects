    <h3>Here's a time line of JJ Thompson life:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <span>1856</span> - Born on 18 December in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, Lancashire, England.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span>1870</span> - he was admitted to Owens College in Manchester (now University of Manchester) at the unusually young age of 14.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span>1876</span> - He moved on to Trinity College, Cambridge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1880</span> - JJ Thomson wins scholarship and becomes second in his class in the graduation exam in mathematics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1884</span> - A Professor of Physics,JJ Thomson became Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics at Cambridge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1895</span> - Thomson began experimental investigations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1897</span> - A corpuscle discovered!,In 1897, a corpuscle (now known as an electron) was discovered using a cathode ray scope.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span>1904</span> - Yum plum pudding!,Thomson suggeested a model of the atom as a sphere of positive matter in which electrongs are positioned by electrostatic forces. Thus, the plum pudding model was created!
        </li>
        <li>
         <span>1906</span> - Nobel Prize, JJ Thomson was awarded the Nobel Prize "in recogniton of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases"..
        </li>
        <li>
        <span>1906</span> - Postive ions,Thomson begins studying positively charged ions, or positive rays.
        </li>
        <li>
        <span>1908</span> - Praise for his student, Rutherford, one of JJ Thomson's students, recieves a Nobel Prize in chemistry.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span>1911</span> - Famous amongst chemists, Niels Bohr leaves England to do postdoctoral research with JJ Thomson.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span>1913</span> - Influential monographs, Thomson published an influential monograph urging chemists to use mass spectrographs in their analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span>1940</span> - JJ Thomson Dies.
        </li>
