            <p class="intro">One of the most difficult crises humanity has ever faced is climate change. 
                Hundreds of millions of lives, countless species and ecosystems, the economy's health and viability, 
                and the planet's future habitability are all on the line. Climate change, fortunately, is reversible. 
                We have the necessary technology. We have the knowledge. Now is the time for leadership—as well as the 
                fortitude to shift course.</p>
        <div class="sol">
         
             <h4 class = shead>Cut emissions</h4>
            <p class= sols>Global warming is mostly caused by carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. Climate change 
                cannot be prevented, but it can be slowed. We must achieve "net zero" carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner to 
                avert the worst effects of climate change. Net zero emissions indicates that no more carbon is released into 
                the atmosphere than is removed. We need a dramatic shift in how we produce and consume electricity to attain 
                net zero emissions. We require a more modern and efficient transportation system. We must put an end to 
                deforestation. A climate-friendly agriculture system is required.</p>
            <h4 class = shead>Remove carbon dioxide</h4>
            <p class= sols>We must do more than just lower our emissions to achieve net zero emissions: we must actively remove 
                carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or balance its impacts. Planting new forests (afforestation) or restoring old 
                ones is the simplest way to do this (reforestation). New technologies that take CO2 out of the air 
                ("direct air capture") or prevent it from exiting smokestacks ("carbon capture and storage") can also help. The key
                 challenges to all of these technologies and techniques are scale, speed, and cost. Strong state and federal policies,
                  as well as large-scale investment in research and development, are critical in the United States.</p>
            <h4 class = shead>Fight disinformation</h4>
            <p class= sols>For years, media commentators, partisan think tanks, and special interest groups sponsored by 
                fossil fuel firms have cast doubt on global warming's reality. These skeptics deny and misrepresent 
                climate change research, advocate for policies that reward polluters, and try to undermine existing 
                pollution standards. This onslaught of misinformation confuses and misleads the public about the mounting 
                implications of global warming, making it more difficult to put in place the remedies that are truly needed.
                 Climate action will be considerably more difficult unless the power of these special interests is significantly 
                 reduced.</p>
            <h4 class = shead>Prepare and adapt</h4>
            <p class= sols>Regardless of how soon we reduce emissions, certain climatic impacts are unavoidable. Sea levels
                 are rising. Every year, temperatures set new records. Droughts, floods, and extreme weather are wreaking 
                 havoc on today's communities. The only long-term approach for averting climatic damage is to reduce carbon 
                 emissions. We must adapt in the short term. This includes everything from preventing growth in high-risk 
                 areas to preparing for water scarcity and constructing more resilient cities and communities. Scientifically sound and socially just investments should be concentrated where the consequences are greatest—often in low-income and minority communities.</p>
